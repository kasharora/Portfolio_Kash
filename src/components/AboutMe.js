  <h3>Hey there, üëã</h3>
  I'm <span>Kashish</span>, a recent graduate who completed <span>B.Tech in CSE</span> in 2023. I have hands-on experience in building websites with a strong focus on responsiveness, accessibility, and clean design aesthetics. My 6-month internship experience in <span>ReactJS</span> has allowed me to sharpen my skills in frontend development and deliver efficient and organized code. Currently, I'm diving into the world of <span>freelancing</span>, where I specialize in crafting engaging user experiences and exploring <span>backend technologies.</span> I'm always on the lookout for <span>new opportunities</span> to collaborate and create impactful software solutions. Let's connect and build something amazing together.
  <br /> <br />
  Beyond coding, <span>I'm an explorer at heart‚ù§Ô∏è</span> ‚Äì always eager to learn new things and take on challenges. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, traveling, and discovering new technologies. It's my way of staying inspired and keeping my creativity alive.
